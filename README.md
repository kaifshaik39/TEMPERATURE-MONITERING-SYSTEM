# TEMPERATURE-MONITERING-SYSTEM

TASK 1 (EMBEDDED SYSTEMS INTERNSHIP)

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: SHAIK MOHAMMED KAIF

INTERN ID: CITS0D758

DOMAIN: EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

BATCH DURATION: JUNE 17th,2025 to AUGUST 2ND,2025 (6 Weeks)

MENTOR NAME: Neela Santhosh Kumar

## üìå Description

The **Temperature Monitoring System** is a beginner-friendly embedded systems project that simulates real-time ambient temperature monitoring using **Arduino** and an **LM35 temperature sensor**. Built and tested in **Tinkercad**, this project demonstrates how to read analog temperature data and display it on a **16x2 I2C LCD**.

This type of system is widely used in **smart homes**, **weather monitoring**, and **industrial automation**, where consistent and accurate temperature tracking is required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- The **LM35 sensor** outputs an analog voltage (10 mV/¬∞C) proportional to the temperature.
- This voltage is read by the Arduino‚Äôs analog pin **A0** and converted to temperature using the formula


- The calculated temperature is then displayed on a **16x2 LCD** using an **I2C module**, which connects to Arduino pins **A4 (SDA)** and **A5 (SCL)**.
- In the Tinkercad simulation, the sensor‚Äôs analog input was manually varied to test system behavior, since physical temperature changes can't be simulated.
